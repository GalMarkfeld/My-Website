    <h2>Educations</h2>
    <div id="education_description">
        <p>Like most of the computer science students, I studied both math and physics at the highest level possible
            during high school.
            <br> In addition, I studied electronics and robotics and that is where my love for hardware initially began.
            <br> In the army, I took a course in Electronic Failure Analysis and my job was mostly air force related
            failure analysis.
            <br> After releasing from the army I took a basic Java course at Udemy and worked as a Failure Analysis
            Technician at <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/">Solaredge</a> where I continued with my work from the
            army while
            also learning a lot about renewal energy and other many interesting subjects.
            <br>I started my computer science degree at October 2020.

<!--hobbies section-->
<section id="Hobbies">
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>On my free time I enjoy researching new and interesting subjects. One of my biggest passions for example is the human body, <br>I read many articles and meta analysis
    regarding many topics from how humans consume calories to tumors and so on. <br> As said before, I like creating stuff of my own, whether by hand or by code. As a result
        I wanted to work on a coding of my own and during the summer I created a Tic Tac Toe app using javaFx. <br>My passion for knowledge most definitely helped me explore both
    the game since I had to come up with many tactics for the computer when a user plays in a single player mode and to explore the javaFx platform.
    <br> In the past I used to practice many sports and played tennis on a competitive level until both of knee's got hurt. <br>Currently, I try to practice sport to the degree my knees let me.
        I also enjoy watching sports with my friends and family and recently I developed a passion for cooking.
