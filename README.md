In order to run the website double-click on the Website.html file
Input validation: I used the input type= email validation and added the required attribute.
The javascript in the website is meant to give the user a way to contact me once
he fills the correct values. 
I tried creating a message box for the user that will email me a notification 
when the user submits the form but wasn't able to, so I added my email an
alert box that pops up whenever the user submit correct details about himself.
